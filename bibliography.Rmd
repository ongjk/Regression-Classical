Citations go inside square brackets and are separated by semicolons. Each citation must have a key, composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the database, and may optionally have a prefix, a locator, and a suffix. Here are some examples


[@12820409320180501, pp. 33-35, 38-39]




The negative before @ will remove the author's name [-@10107018420150301]



Removing the brackets will show the author and year. @PHL237024920180301
